Getting Started with PyTorch - Key Takeaways
============================================

Matrix Fundamentals
-------------------
1. A matrix is a table-like arrangement of numbers.
2. Matrix arithmetic (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) is useful in solving many problems.
3. In neural networks, weights are efficiently multiplied with outputs from previous layers using matrix multiplication.
4. GPUs are popular for deep learning due to their ability to compute dot products in parallel.
5. Two types of multiplication: (1) Element-wise (Hadamard), (2) Matrix multiplication.
6. Rule: Columns of the first matrix must equal the rows of the second for multiplication.

PyTorch Tensor Basics
----------------------
1. A tensor is a generic term for scalars (0D), vectors (1D), matrices (2D), etc.
2. Tensors can have any number of dimensions.
3. `torch.Tensor` can create tensor objects, similar to NumPy arrays but can be stored directly in GPU memory.
4. Tensors have attributes like `dtype`, `shape`, and `device`.
5. The `view()` method reshapes a tensor.
6. Use functions like `zeros()`, `ones()`, `rand()` to create tensors.
7. API syntax can be looked up anytimeâ€”no need to memorize.

Derivatives & Chain Rule
------------------------
1. The slope of a line at a point is the derivative.
2. For \( X^n \), derivative is \( n \cdot X^{n-1} \).
3. Derivatives are used for nonlinear equations; slope is constant in linear ones.
4. A partial derivative changes one variable while keeping others constant.
5. Chain rule helps compute the derivative of a function composed of multiple functions and is used in gradient descent.

PyTorch Autograd
----------------
1. Autograd automatically calculates gradients during backpropagation.
2. Use `torch.no_grad` to temporarily disable gradient calculation.

Numpy Array vs PyTorch Tensor
-----------------------------
1. PyTorch tensors are similar to NumPy arrays but offer advantages:
   - GPU acceleration support.
   - Built-in autograd feature for gradient computation.
   - Deep integration with PyTorch ecosystem for DL tasks.
